<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4842270/">TRAILER</a>

This is a comedy movie about 2 ex-bestfriends working to solve a mystery kidnapping of a beauty queen from uzeklovakia just in time before the big pageant show. I enjoyed watching this movie because of all the funny scenes, the perfect comedic timing, and some scenes were tear jerkers as well.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247638/plotsummary/?ref_=tt_ov_pl">TRAILER</a>

This movie is about a normal teenage girl who finds out she is an heir to a country called Genovia. I liked this movie from my childhood because it's so nostalgic and as a little girl, I loved seeing the main character get a makeover and learn how to become a princess because disney princesses were my favorite as a child and I had a whole shelf of books full of fairytale books.


<h1> <li> Red Notice </li> </h1>

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7991608/">TRAILER</a>

This movie is about an agent who seeks to find a famous thief who steals art with the help of a rival thief. I like this movie because of all the good actions scenes as well as there were so many plot twists that left me in shock.
